# Intern Project: Access to African Agriculture Data

<br>

**Overview:**

Agriculture drives global health, economic development, and food security. Yet in many African nations, reliable agricultural data remains inaccessible due to bureaucratic barriers. This limits the ability of farmers, policymakers, and businesses to make informed decisions.

The **goal of this project** is to make agricultural data from hard-to-access regions, starting with Nigeria, publicly available. By compiling and standardizing data—often requiring formal requests to governments—we aim to reduce the friction for anyone interested who need reliable information. This will help improve resource management, food security, and sustainable practices.

**Problem Statement:**

Inaccessible, unstructured agricultural data prevents evidence-based decision-making in many African countries, including Nigeria. This project seeks to solve that problem by streamlining access to agricultural data, enabling better decisions for optimizing crop yields, managing water resources, and addressing climate challenges.

**Current Focus:** Nigeria

Our initial focus is Nigeria, where we are collecting and structuring data related to:

-   Agricultural land use

-   Climate change impacts

-   Food production and economic links

-   Water supply

-   Crop and livestock production

-   Land ownership

-   Agricultural trade

**Future Expansion:**

Once a model is built for Nigeria, we plan to expand to other African countries, contributing to the goal of accessible agricultural data across the continent.
