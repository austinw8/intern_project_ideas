**Overview:**

Agriculture is at the heart of global health. It provides the food and resources needed to sustain human life and support economic development. It serves as the backbone of food security as well as a significant role in environmental sustainability, economic stability, and poverty reduction.

The goal of this project is to design a database and data pipeline that connects agricultural data sets and provides insights that can guide farmers and policymakers in making informed decisions. We hope to contribute to food security, optimize resource allocation, and promote sustainable agricultural practices in the face of global challenges.
