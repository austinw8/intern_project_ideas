Dataset ideas:
1. **Agricultural dataset**:
	***Crop Production Data:*** Information on yields, farming practices, and the impact of climate change.
	***Market Prices:*** Real-time data on prices for agricultural products to help farmers make informed decisions.
	***Land Use and Ownership:*** Data on land tenure, land use patterns, and access to water resources.

	Improved agricultural data can enhance food security, optimize resource allocation, and support farmers with better 		tools and information.Advanced technologies such as precision farming, predictive analytics, and data-driven decision
	support systems have transformed agriculture, increasing efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. This has
	resulted in optimized crop yields, improved livestock management, improved supply chain logistics, and a lower			environmental impact.

3. Telecommunication dataset:
4. Housing dataset:
5. Health care dataset: Health data from rural and remote regions is often underreported, particularly on endemic diseases, maternal health, and healthcare infrastructure.
Access to comprehensive health data can improve healthcare delivery, resource allocation, and pandemic preparedness.
