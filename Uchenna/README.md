## **Project Ideas**

This folder contains three datasets suggestions for use on the package development project. they include :


### **Global Warming and Climate Change** 

Rising global temperatures are causing severe weather events, sea level rise, and biodiversity loss, impacting ecosystems and communities worldwide. Issues like deforestation, plastic pollution, and air quality deterioration also contributing to long-term environmental damage and resource depletion.

#### **Potential Focus Areas**

-  **Global temperature anomalies**

-  **Air Quality Deterioration**

-  **Greenhouse gas concentrations**
  

#### **Data Sources**

-  [NASA Climate Data](https://climate.nasa.gov/): Provides satellite data, temperature records, and sea level rise.

-  [IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)](https://www.ipcc-data.org/): Provides scientific assessments and comprehensive data on climate change impacts, vulnerabilities, and mitigation efforts.

-  [World Bank Climate Change Data](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/): Provides historical climate data, vulnerability indices, and adaptation strategies by country and region.

-  [Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/): Provides comprehensive data on carbon emissions, carbon sinks, and the carbon cycle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


### **Sustainability and Renewable Energy**

The transition to renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change

#### **Potential Focus Areas**

-  **Global Energy Production (Renewable and Non-Renewable)**

-  **Lifecycle Analysis of Renewable Technologies**

#### **Data Sources**

-  [International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)](https://www.irena.org/): Provides global data on renewable energy capacity, investments, and policies.

-  [World Bank Energy](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators): Includes renewable energy statistics and data on global energy projects, financing, and access to energy.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


### **Food Security and Agriculture**

The need for sustainable agricultural practices is becoming more critical due to population growth, resource depletion, and climate change coupled with water shortages affecting agriculture, industry, and daily life in many parts of the world.

#### **Potential Focus Areas**

-  **Global Food Production**
  
-  **Water Shortages**
  
-  **Land Use and Ownership**

#### **Data Sources**

-  [FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/): Comprehensive data on global agricultural production, trade, food security, and land use.

-  [World Bank Agriculture Data](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/agriculture-and-rural-development): Agricultural productivity, rural population, land use, and rural development data across countries.

-  [CGIAR (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research)](https://www.cgiar.org/): Agricultural research data on crops, livestock, fisheries, and water management.


###   **Spotify Songs and Albums** 

Access to millions of songs released on Spotify and their albums up to 2024 - this was added for fun, but might turn out to be useful, maybe.

#### **Data Sources**

-  [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/): The Spotify Web API provides access to detailed music data, including track metadata, audio features, user playlists, artist information, and more.

  #### **Potential Use-Case**

  A library that provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing Spotify's Web API allowing you to pull data like track audio features, playlists, and artist details programmatically.

  

Cheers!
