## **Project Ideas**

This folder contains three datasets as suggestions for use on the package development project. they include :

-   **World temperature data** : This includes daily temperature measurements from every major city around the world from 1995 - 2020

-   **Global Power Plants** : A database of 35,000 power plants from 167 countries and includes thermal plants (e.g coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g hydro, wind, solar)

-   **Spotify Songs and Albums** : A database of over 350,000 songs released on Spotify and their albums up to 2023 - this was added for fun, but might turn out to be useful, maybe.

Cheers!
