Below are my ideas for our database project.

### **1. Entrepreneurship and Innovation**

Examine entrepreneurship and innovation trends (what fosters or hinders business creation and growth, best practices, gender disparities, government policies/regulations, start-up success rates, access to funding, innovation indices, etc.).

We could focus on a specific sector/industry of interest, or a specific region.

#### **Potential Data Sources**

-   [Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)](https://www.gemconsortium.org/): Data on entrepreneurial activity and environment across countries.

-   [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/entrepreneurship): Entrepreneurship and innovation data, including business creation rates.

-   [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/dashboards/oecd-data-lake-on-smes-and-entrepreneurship.html): Reports and statistics on innovation and economic development.

-   Start-up Ecosystems Data: Local and regional data on start-up performance, funding, and innovation hubs.

-   [World Economic Forum](https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1Gb0000000LGqtEAG/key-issues/a1Gb0000001kBXkEAM): Global Innovation Index and reports on entrepreneurship.

#### **Why entrepreneurship?** 

Entrepreneurship is "an engine of economic growth" as it promotes innovation & productivity, creates employment, and addresses societyâ€™s greatest challenges.

This project could promotes economic growth by identifying ways to support entrepreneurship and innovation. It can help policymakers, investors, governments, and business leaders make informed decisions that lead to business creation and growth.

The project can also highlight the challenges faced by underrepresented groups, such as women entrepreneurs, and propose solutions to bridge the gaps.

#### **Possible Data Tables**

-   Countries: Basic information about each country (name, GDP, population, etc.)

-   Entrepreneurship Rates: Data on the number of startups, business density, etc.

-   Funding: Information on venture capital, angel investments, and other funding sources.

-   Regulations: Data on government policies, tax incentives, and ease of doing business.

-   Gender Disparities: Data on gender gaps in entrepreneurship, funding access, etc.

-   Innovation Index: Scores and rankings from global innovation indices.

### **2. Global Human Rights**

Analyze global human rights violations. This could cover a range of issues, including political repression, freedom of speech, gender equality, freedom of movement, and refugee crises to name a few. The goal would be to create an understanding of the state of human rights across the globe, identify trends as well as regions of interest to focus aid on, and to evaluate the effectiveness of international policies.

#### **Potential Data Sources**

-   [CIRIGHTS Project](https://cirights.com/)

-   [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/): Reports on human rights violations globally.

-   [Human Rights Watch:](https://www.hrw.org/publications) Country-specific reports and annual reviews.

-   [UN Human Rights Council](https://www.ohchr.org/en/resources/databases): Data on compliance with international human rights treaties.

-   [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/explore-the-map?type=fiw&year=2024&status[not-free]=not-free&status[partly-free]=partly-free&status[free]=free): Reports on political freedom and civil liberties.

#### **Why human rights?** 

Studying and collecting data on global human rights has significant social value by raising awareness of human rights issues and supporting advocacy efforts. The data could inform international policies and aid organizations in directing resources to areas with the most pressing needs, as well as identifying government structures and/or policies that promote human rights.

This can also support the work of NGOs and other oganizations fighting for justice and equality worldwide.

#### **Possible Data Tables:**

-   **Countries:** Basic information about each country (name, region, population, etc.)

-   Human Rights Scores: Indications of governments respect for its citizens' human rights.

-   **Violations:** Detailed records of human rights violations, including type, severity, and date.

-   **Organizations:** List of NGOs, governments, and agencies involved in human rights advocacy.

### **3. Gun Violence and Firearm Regulations**

Analyze gun violence and firearm regulations, with a focus on understanding patterns in gun-related incidents and the impact of different firearm regulations. We could include data on gun deaths (homicides, suicides, accidental), firearm ownership rates, background checks, and state or national gun control laws.

Depending on data availability and our interests, we could focus on specific states in the U.S. or compare gun violence trends across countries.

#### **Potential Data Sources**

-   [CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm): Data on gun-related deaths, including homicides, suicides, and accidental deaths.

-   [FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation):](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls) Crime data, including gun-related incidents and background checks.

-   FiveThirtyFive: [Gun death data](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/simplified-gun-deaths/) and [American's public stand on gun control](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/guns-parkland-polling-quiz/)

-   [ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives)](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/firearms-trace-data-2020): Data on firearm regulations and ownership.

-   State Gun Registries: Data on firearm ownership and licensing at the state level.

-   NGOs (e.g., Giffords Law Center): Information on gun control laws and advocacy efforts.

-   Mass Shooting Tracker: Data on mass shooting incidents in the U.S. and internationally.

#### **Why gun control?** 

Gun control and violence is a critical public safety issue. This data could inform debates on gun control and violence prevention. The findings could support policy decisions and advocacy efforts aimed at reducing gun violence.

This data could also provide valuable insights into any relationships between firearm regulations and public safety.

#### **Possible Data Tables:** 

-   States/Countries: Basic information about each state or country (name, population, etc.)

-   Gun Violence Incidents: Data on individual incidents, including type (homicide, suicide, etc.), location, and date.

-   Firearm Ownership: Data on ownership rates, licensing, and registration.

-   Gun Control Laws: Information on state or national gun control laws, background check requirements, etc.

-   Mass Shootings: Detailed records of mass shooting incidents, including location, number of casualties, and weapon type.
